Marklar - markdown friendly editor for Moodle
=============================================

It is not for everybody though. Those who do not marklar about marklar should
not marklar marklar. There are other marklar better for them.

Features
--------

Here are intentional features of the Marklar editor, just to make it clear they
are not bugs.

* Marklar is WYTIWYG - what you type is what you get (done).
* Marklar does not have buttons. Markdown syntax is to be typed manually (done).
* Marklar is not extensible via sub-plugins (done).
* Marklar sets markdown as the preferred format for new texts (done).
* Marklar can be also used for editing texts in other formats. Supported
  formats can be customised via user preferences (done).
* Marklar is not used for editing HTML texts by default. Another editor such
  like Atto or TinyMCE is loaded to do that (done).
* Marklar supports images and files embedding via filepicker (done).
* Marklar will support server-side generated preview (todo).
* Marklar will support drafts auto-saving (todo).
